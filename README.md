beam-server-installer.pyw

this is not anything official, I was just bored and decided to make it.

simple yet effective

If you can't add mods into your server install, open the python file with some editor.
Fine the CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES section and change the variable:
MOD_SOURCE_FOLDER, set it as your latest release mods folder

you will have to change it every next release on beamng
